# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is QuickFCM?
**QuickFCM** is a CLI tool that sets up Firebase Cloud Messaging push notifications in React projects with a single command. It handles all the complex setup including service workers, token management, and backend integration.

### How is this different from Firebase's official setup?
- **Simplicity**: One command vs manual setup
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically detects your project structure
- **Backend support**: Includes Express/NestJS scaffolding
- **Conflict resolution**: Handles existing files gracefully
- **Production ready**: Generates complete, working code

### Do I need to know Firebase to use this?
No! The CLI guides you through getting your Firebase configuration and handles all the technical implementation. You just need to:
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Copy the configuration values
3. Run the CLI

## Installation & Setup

### Do I need to install anything?
No installation required! Use it directly with:
```bash
npx quick-fcm init
```

### Can I install it globally?
Yes:
```bash
npm install -g quick-fcm
quick-fcm init
```

### What are the system requirements?
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- **React or Next.js** frontend project (any version)
- Firebase project (free tier works)

> If the CLI detects that your project has neither `react` nor `next` in its dependencies, it **exits immediately** with a clear message. To scaffold backend-only (Express / NestJS), use `--backend-only`:
> ```bash
> npx quick-fcm init --backend-only
> ```

### Will this work with my existing React project?
Yes! The CLI is designed to work with any React project:
- Create React App
- Next.js (Pages and App Router)
- Vite
- Custom webpack setups
- TypeScript or JavaScript

### Does it work with Next.js App Router?
Yes. The CLI **automatically detects** whether your project uses the App Router (`app/` directory) or Pages Router (`pages/` directory) and logs the result:
```
✓  Detected framework: Next.js (App Router)
```
or
```
✓  Detected framework: Next.js (Pages Router)
```
All generated client components include `'use client'`. For App Router projects, use the generated `NotificationHandler/` inside a Client Component layout. See [Next.js Example](./EXAMPLES.md#nextjs-app-router-integration).

## Configuration

### Where is the configuration stored?
All configuration is stored in `quickfcm.config.json` in your project root. This file contains:
- Firebase configuration
- Backend endpoints
- Project metadata (language, framework, router type)
- Version compatibility info

### How do credentials get stored?
All credentials are stored in `quickfcm.config.json` at your project root. The generated `config.ts`/`config.js` reads directly from this file — **no `.env` file, no environment variable prefixes** (`VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) needed. `quickfcm.config.json` is automatically added to `.gitignore` so it is never committed.

### What happens if I run `init` twice?
Safe to run multiple times. The CLI detects existing files and offers conflict resolution options (overwrite, skip, view diff). Your existing `quickfcm.config.json` will be updated with the new values you enter.

### Does the CLI install firebase and quick-fcm for me?
Yes. Before scaffolding any files, the CLI checks your `package.json`. If `firebase` or `quick-fcm` is missing, it installs both automatically using your project's package manager:
- Detects `pnpm-lock.yaml` → uses `pnpm`
- Detects `yarn.lock` → uses `yarn`
- Otherwise → uses `npm`

Install order: `quick-fcm` first, then `firebase`. If a package is already present, it is silently skipped. If an install fails, a warning is shown and setup continues — you can install manually.

### My project is JavaScript, not TypeScript. What gets generated?
All generated files use JavaScript extensions. The exact extension matches your existing project convention:
- If your project has `.jsx` files (Vite / CRA style) → generates `PushNotificationManager.jsx`, `PushProvider.jsx`, etc.
- If your project has no `.jsx` files (Next.js default JS) → generates `PushNotificationManager.js`, `PushProvider.js`, etc.

Logic files (`config.js`, `pushHelper.js`) always use plain `.js` — they contain no JSX.

The files contain no TypeScript syntax — plain ES module files that work with any JS React/Next.js setup.

### Can I change the configuration after setup?
Yes! Simply edit `quickfcm.config.json`. The changes will be picked up immediately.

### What if I lose my Firebase credentials?
You can regenerate them:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
2. Generate new private key
3. Update the `credentials.json` file path in `quickfcm.config.json`

### How do I update Firebase configuration?
Edit `quickfcm.config.json`:
```json
{
  "firebase": {
    "apiKey": "your-new-api-key",
    "authDomain": "your-new-auth-domain",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

## Browser & Permissions

### Do users need to grant permission?
Yes, users must grant notification permission. The CLI handles this with a graceful fallback:
- Shows permission request
- Handles denial gracefully
- Provides guidance for enabling in browser settings

### Will this work on all browsers?
Modern browsers that support:
- Service Workers
- Push API
- Notifications API
- Firebase SDK requirements

Supported browsers:
- Chrome (desktop & mobile)
- Firefox (desktop & mobile)
- Safari (limited support)
- Edge (Chromium-based)

### Does this require HTTPS?
Yes, for production:
- **Development**: Works on `localhost`
- **Production**: Requires HTTPS (required by browsers for push notifications)

### What about mobile browsers?
Yes! Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) on mobile devices support push notifications through the same implementation.

## Backend Integration

### Do I need a backend?
Not necessarily! You can:
- **Frontend only**: Use Firebase Console to send notifications
- **With backend**: Enable token management and targeted notifications

### Which backend frameworks are supported?
- **Express**: Automatic detection and scaffolding
- **NestJS**: Automatic detection and scaffolding
- **Custom**: Use the generated helpers as reference

### What if I don't use Express or NestJS?
The generated helper files are framework-agnostic. You can adapt them to:
- Fastify
- Koa
- Hapi
- Custom Node.js servers
- Other languages (Python, Ruby, etc.)

### Do I need Firebase Admin SDK?
Yes, for backend features like:
- Sending targeted notifications
- Token management
- Custom notification logic

The CLI scaffolds this for you automatically.

## Notification Features

### Can I send notifications with images?
Yes! Include an `icon` or `image` field:
```javascript
{
  notification: {
    title: "New Message",
    body: "You have a new message",
    icon: "/message-icon.png",
    image: "/preview-image.jpg"
  }
}
```

### Can I send custom data?
Yes! Use the `data` field:
```javascript
{
  notification: { title: "New Order", body: "Order #123" },
  data: {
    orderId: "123",
    customerId: "456",
    route: "/orders/123"
  }
}
```

### How do I handle notification clicks?
The service worker automatically handles clicks and can navigate to routes. You can customize this behavior in the generated service worker.

### Can I schedule notifications?
Not directly through the CLI, but you can:
- Use Firebase Cloud Functions
- Implement scheduling in your backend
- Use cron jobs with your backend

## Security & Privacy

### Is my Firebase config secure?
The web config (API keys, etc.) is public by design and safe to expose. The sensitive credentials (service account) should never be exposed to the frontend.

### Should I commit credentials.json?
No! The CLI automatically adds `credentials.json` to `.gitignore`.

### How do I handle authentication?
The CLI scaffolds token registration endpoints. You should:
- Add authentication middleware
- Associate tokens with user accounts
- Validate requests

### What about GDPR/compliance?
You're responsible for:
- Getting user consent
- Providing opt-out options
- Handling data requests
- Complying with relevant regulations

## Troubleshooting

### No package.json found"
Make sure you're running the command from your React project root directory where `package.json` is located.

### Permission denied"
Users must enable notifications in their browser settings. Provide clear instructions in your UI.

### Service worker failed to register"
Check that:
- Service worker is in `public/` directory
- You're using HTTPS (or localhost)
- No JavaScript errors in console

### Notifications not working in production"
Verify:
- HTTPS is properly configured
- Firebase project settings include your production domain
- Service worker is accessible at the correct path

### Backend token registration fails"
Check:
- Backend is running and accessible
- CORS is configured correctly
- Firebase Admin SDK is properly initialized

## Scaling & Performance

### Can this handle many users?
Yes! The implementation uses:
- Firebase's scalable infrastructure
- Efficient token management
- Minimal client-side overhead

### What are the limits?
Firebase free tier includes:
- 10,000 messages per day
- Unlimited devices (with some limitations)
- Check Firebase pricing for higher tiers

### How do I monitor performance?
Use:
- Firebase Console analytics
- Your backend monitoring
- Browser developer tools
- Custom logging in the generated helpers

##  Updates & Maintenance

### How do I update the setup?
Run the CLI again:
```bash
npx quick-fcm init
```
It will detect existing files and offer to update them.

### Will updates break my code?
No! The CLI:
- Preserves your custom changes
- Only updates generated files
- Shows diffs before applying changes

### How do I update Firebase SDK?
```bash
npm install firebase@latest
```
> **Note**: The CLI installs a specific pinned version of `firebase` that is known to be compatible. If you upgrade manually, test that push notifications still work correctly.

### What about React updates?
The generated code is framework-agnostic and should work with React updates. Test thoroughly after major React version changes.
